Now, it is your turn!\n","\n","For your project assignment, I want you to do the following tasks. Herefore, use the data provided in the colab file: \"Projektarbeit 2022 Hilfsdatei.ipynb\"\n","\n","1. Estimate an appropriate benchmark model using either the linear, logistic or softmax regression model for each of the target variables. You can decide which time periods to use for training and testing. The results generated with these models serve as benchmark results and you should compare them to results which are developed by yourself during the project.\n","\n","2. Estimate and develop models for each of the target variables using either the DecisionTreeRegressor or DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn. Hereby, make use of the GridSearchCV schedule to find good hyperparameters. Again, the time period can be chosen by yourself as well as the choices for hyperparameters and number of splits for the grid search.\n","\n","3. Estimate and develop models for each of the target variables using either the GradientBoostingRegressor or GradientBoostingClassifier from sklearn. Or any other Gradientbossting from other packages. Hereby, make use of the GridSearchCV schedule to find good hyperparameters. Again, the time period can be chosen by yourself as well as the choices for hyperparameters and number of splits for the grid search.\n","\n","NOTE: Take into account that grid search hyperparameter tuning can take very long. I do not expect you to try out hyperparameter and split combinations which take excessively long, I rather want to see, that you are able to conduct hyperparameter tuning.\n","\n","4. Find out which technical indicators are most important for your tree and boosting based models. Choose a subset of important technical indicators and re-estimate the models only with these indicators, what is the impact on previous results?\n","\n","5. Estimate company specific models using only the data from that company. For at least 2 companies. Compare your results with the ones of the model which uses all data regarding the metrics/scores. What do you observe? Additionaly compare feature importances between these models, inspect singular features for these companies (compare them, look at correlations to the respective target variable (graphically as well as numerical)). Discuss your observations.\n","\n","6. Write a final summary with no more than 500 words what you think are the most important aspects of your model development and the corresponding results."],"metadata":{"id":"T_nXF1gs1n_m"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Formal look of your assignment\n","\n","The project assignment is supposed to be in notebook (ipynb) format. I am asking you to think about a clear and consistent way for presenting your results. Please avoid any form of redudancy! This means, even though you are supposed to make various exeperiments with the models including hyperparameter search, I do not want to see all your experiements. I rather prefer to be guided by you what you did and see a short demonstration with a code example and/or your final model."],"metadata":{"id":"tB0jCYCa6EKG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# What I am looking for when grading your assigment\n","\n","During grading your work, I will give 50 points which get together as follows:\n","\n","* Consistent und clear presentation of your work and your results (15 points)\n","* Reasonable and correct discussion about what you are doing and what you observe (20 points)\n","* Redudancy of your work. Be precise and avoid meaningless repetitions (10 points)\n","* Appropriate extent of your work (5 points)\n","\n","Do not worry if you are not able to successfully work through all the tasks. In many cases this will not cause major deterioration or your final result."],"metadata":{"id":"r7vTJuVJ7Pnt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Until when you should be finished\n","\n","Please send your final project assignment until September 14, 2022 (12 pm) to lukas.marx@uni-passau.de!"],"metadata":{"id":"1OEUrTeU8OmS"}}]}
